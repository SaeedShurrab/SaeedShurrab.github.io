    # summary: |
    #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently doing a PhD Biomedical Engineering at New York University Abu Dhabi and Tandon School of Engineering - NYU, as a global PhD fellow. He earned his MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from Jordan University of Science and Technology, where he was awarded the prestigious German Academic Exchange Scholarship (DAAD) and graduated with distinction in 2022. Before this, he completed his BSc in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza, Palestine, in 2014. Saeed‚Äôs passion for data analytics and his strong belief in the transformative power of data in driving robust decision-making and innovative solutions led him to pursue a career in data science.
