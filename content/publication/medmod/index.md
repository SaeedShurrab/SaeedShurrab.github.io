abstract: "Multimodal machine learning provides a myriad of opportunities for developing models that integrate multiple modalities and mimic decision-making in the real-world, such as in medical settings. However, benchmarks involving multimodal medical data are scarce, especially routinely collected modalities such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Chest X-ray images (CXR). To contribute towards advancing multimodal learning in tackling real-world prediction tasks, we present MedMod, a multimodal medical benchmark with EHR and CXR using publicly available datasets MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR, respectively. MedMod comprises five clinical prediction tasks: clinical conditions, in-hospital mortality, decompensation, length of stay, and radiological findings. We extensively evaluate several multimodal supervised learning models and self-supervised learning frameworks, making all of our code and models open-source."
